Black and White image to Colorization.

# Black-and-White-Image-Colorization-with-OpenCV-and-DeepLearning

This project focuses on converting grayscale (black & white) images into realistic colorized images using a deep learning–based colorization model integrated with OpenCV.
The system takes a monochrome image as input and predicts the most probable colors for different regions based on image features and semantic understanding learned during training.

Colorization is a challenging task because a grayscale pixel provides only intensity information. The model must predict color values (a/b channels) using context — objects, edges, shapes, textures, and semantics.

->Project Objectives

Automatically colorize black & white images with high visual quality

Use a pretrained deep neural network model for lab-space color prediction

Implement an end-to-end colorization pipeline using OpenCV

Demonstrate deep learning–powered visual enhancement for historical images, photography restoration, and artistic effects

-> Deep Learning Approach

The project uses a pretrained Caffe-based deep learning model for image colorization, integrated with OpenCV’s DNN module.

-> How It Works

Convert the input image from RGB → LAB color space

Extract the L channel (lightness) — this is the grayscale input

Pass the L channel through the deep neural network

The model predicts the a/b chrominance channels

Merge predicted ab channels with original L channel

Convert back to BGR/RGB to obtain the colorized image

-> Pretrained Model

The project uses:

colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt (model architecture)

colorization_release_v2.caffemodel (trained weights)

These were trained on over 1.3 million images from the ImageNet dataset to learn color distribution patterns.
